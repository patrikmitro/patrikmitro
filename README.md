### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Patrik Mitro and I'm a full-stack developer currently studying in KoÅ¡ice. I primarily use React, SCSS, and TypeScript.

Here on my Github, you'll find various projects I've worked on, ranging from small personal projects to larger team collaborations. Feel free to browse through my repositories and see the code I've written.
